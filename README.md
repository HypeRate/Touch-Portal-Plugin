# HypeRate for Touch Portal

HypeRate lets you create event-based actions triggered by your heart rate for Twitch or any live streaming platform! Create polaroids, clips, control your Hue lights depending on the threshold you set, or trigger any other flow you have on your mind.

## Functionality
- Able to track current Heartrate of a connected user (based on ID in settings)
- Perform actions based on specific heartrate (above heartrate X, below heartrate X, at heartrate X)

## Installation
1. Download the extension
2. Open Touch Portal, go to "Plugin Settings" and import the Plugin
3. Restart Touch Portal
4. Enter your HypeRate ID in the Settings and Press "Start"
5. Don't forget to save!
6. Go to "Events" and create an Event and give it a sweet name 
7. In the event list select "When Plugin State changes" and THEN define the heart rate you want to trigger the event 
8. Be creative! :) You can now choose from all of the options available to trigger actions based on your heart rate! Feels almost like coding, does it? ^^
